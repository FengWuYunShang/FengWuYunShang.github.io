# About Me


<img src="/images/Hello.jpg"  class="floatpic" with="2000"  height="1000">

<br>Here is **Shuai Zhang (张帅)**.

<br>First of all, thank you for your reading. My name is Zhang Shuai, born in 2004, from Renqiu, Hebei Province. I am currently a 2022-level undergraduate student at Ocean University of China, majoring in **Electronic Information Engineering**. In my daily life and study, I almost follow a "four-point, four-line" routine: dormitory - cafeteria - classroom - laboratory. You might think it's boring, but a person truly passionate about robots would find it fascinating. 

<br>During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Innovation Practice Center of my university and gradually developed a strong interest in fields such as **"Robots and Embedded systems"**. In the first three years of university, I participated in over ten projects, including those related to robots, intelligent vehicles, enterprise collaborations, and personal learning. Among them, there was one national-level project and one university-level project. (For details, please visit: [Project page](https://fengwuyunshang.github.io/projects/)) Besides projects, I also took part in five science and technology competitions of various scales and won two national awards and eight provincial and ministerial awards. (For details, please visit: [Awards page](https://fengwuyunshang.github.io/Awards/)) 

<br>Currently, I am also preparing for activities such as **summer camps and pre-recommendation** for exemption from the postgraduate entrance examination, making thorough preparations for the recommendation and exemption process. My expected research directions include robot control, such as but not limited to robotic arms, quadruped robot dogs, bionic robots, exoskeletons, medical robots, robots for complex environments, multi-agent cooperative systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, humanoid robots, embodied intelligence, general intelligence, and so on. **If you are a teacher who has come to know me from my resume or email content, I am very much looking forward to your reply and hope you can consider me.**

<br>Finally, if you are interested in my resume or the field of robotics, I would be very glad if you could contact me. You can reach me via email at **ShuangZhang1226@163.com** or add my WeChat **(z15227553417)** to communicate with me.
