# About Me


<img src="/images/Hello.jpg"  alt="/images/Hello" class="floatpic" with="1000">

<br>Here is **Shuai Zhang (张帅)**.

<br>First of all, thank you for reading. My name is Zhang Shuai. I was born in 2004 in Renqiu, Hebei Province. I am a 2022 undergraduate student at Ocean University of China, majoring in **Electronic Information Engineering**. Currently, I have been admitted to Harbin Institute of Technology for further studies. Starting from September next year, I will embark on my master's journey at Harbin Institute of Technology.

<br>During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Innovation Practice Center of my university and gradually developed a strong interest in fields such as "Embedded Systems, Robotics, Robotic Arms, Intelligent vehicles, and the Internet of Things". In the first three years of university, I participated in over ten projects, including those related to robots, intelligent vehicles, corporate collaborations, and personal learning, among which there were two national-level innovation projects. (For details, please visit: [Project page](https://fengwuyunshang.github.io/projects/)) Apart from projects, I also took part in five s&t competitions of various scales and won several national and provincial awards. (For details, please visit: [Awards page](https://fengwuyunshang.github.io/awards/))

<br>Currently, I am studying knowledge in the field of **Embedded Software** with a focus on **Linux**. I hope to secure an internship in this area in the first half of next year (2026). If you find my resume interesting and believe I am a suitable candidate for your company, I would be very much looking forward to your contact.

<br>You can reach me for communication via email at **ShuangZhang1226@163.com** or WeChat at **z15227553417**.
